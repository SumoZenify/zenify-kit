# Output contract — worker and verifier

Both formats are fixed so that the verifier can parse the worker file mechanically and the lead
can build the findings table without re-reading pages.

## Worker file (`worker-<n>.md`)

```
# <sub-question, one line>

Done when: <criterion copied from the prompt>

## Findings

According to https://example.org/docs/config: "The `timeout` option defaults to 30 seconds and
applies per request."
→ The library's default request timeout is 30 s.

According to https://example.org/changelog#v4: "v4.0 removed the `legacyMode` flag."
→ `legacyMode` no longer exists from v4.

## Not found

not found: pricing per seat — tried "example pricing", https://example.org/pricing (403)

## Calls used: 9/12
```

Rules: one blank line between blocks; the quote is copied verbatim, at most three sentences;
the claim is one sentence; a gap always names what was tried.

## Verifier file (`verify.md`)

```
worker-1.md:1 | https://example.org/docs/config | VERIFIED
worker-1.md:2 | https://example.org/changelog#v4 | QUOTE-MISMATCH
worker-2.md:1 | https://example.net/blog/post | DEAD-URL

totals: VERIFIED 1 · QUOTE-MISMATCH 1 · DEAD-URL 1 · NOT-FETCHED 0
```

Status meanings: `VERIFIED` quote found on the fetched page (verbatim, or equal after collapsing
whitespace and punctuation) · `QUOTE-MISMATCH` page fetched, quote absent · `DEAD-URL` fetch
failed · `NOT-FETCHED` verifier ran out of cap or time.

## Worker return (at most 40 lines)
