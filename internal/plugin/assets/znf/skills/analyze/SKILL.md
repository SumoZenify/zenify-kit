# znf:analyze — inspect spec+plan before coding

**Announce:** "Using znf:analyze to inspect the spec+plan before implementation."

This skill runs in a forked context: the spec and plan paths are given in the argument (the text after the skill name)
(absolute paths, spec first). Everything you need is in those two files and this skill.

Checks a written spec+plan pair against `znf:_shared/constitution` (P1–P9) and
`znf:_shared/spec-template` (8-field Brief). **Advisory:** reports findings, does NOT block progress.
Two layers — mechanical (command) then judgment (skill).

## When to use

- After the spec **and** plan both exist, before dispatching the implementer (cook calls it here).
- Or invoke by hand: `/analyze <spec.md> <plan.md>` on any pair.

## Step 1 — mechanical scan (deterministic)

Run the command that reads coverage/marker/structural checks — this part must NOT be left to the LLM to count by hand:

```
zenify analyze --spec <spec-path> --plan <plan-path>
```

Read the output:
- **Coverage** — orphan FR (a requirement no task covers, CRITICAL), orphan task (a task that
  declares no `_Requirements:`, HIGH), dangling ref (plan cites an FR the spec doesn't have, HIGH).
- **Marker** — any leftover `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION` (HIGH), with line numbers.
- **Brief** — whether `## Brief` exists, and how many of the 8 fields are present.
- **Risk-metadata** — Brief missing the `_Blast-radius:` / `_DB:` / `_Rollback:` tag (HIGH per tag).

The command fails open: if it reports "could not analyze," note it and move on — don't treat it as a blocking error.

Then record the plan's size for route calibration (best-effort, no output expected):

```
zenify route-log record-plan --plan <plan-path>
```

## Step 2 — four judgment passes (what the command can't do)

Read the spec+plan by eye and use judgment; each finding is severity **MEDIUM**:

1. **SC-testable (constitution P3).** Is each SC shaped as Given/When/Then, or an "the system
   shall" sentence that can actually be checked? An SC that's prose-only and not checkable → MEDIUM.
2. **Necessity (P6).** Does the Brief's "approach" field justify *which existing path can't already
   handle this* (necessity ladder)? Missing that justification when something new is being built → MEDIUM.
3. **db-3 + comprehension floor (P7).** Is the DB-guarantees block real (states query-plan / tenant-scope /
   keyset, or a justified N/A) or hand-waved? Does the spec describe the real flow + blast-radius before
   proposing any cut? Missing → MEDIUM.
4. **Risk-metadata substance (P9).** Do the three tags have real substance (the mechanical check only
   checks presence/emptiness — substance is this pass's job): does `_Blast-radius:` name the actual repos
   that would break; does `_DB:` cover every applicable concern (query-plan / tenant-scope / keyset) or
   carry a legitimate `N/A`; is `_Rollback:` feasible and does it name a prod-watch signal. Hand-waved → MEDIUM.

## Step 3 — report

Merge mechanical + judgment findings, sort by severity (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM), print concisely.
**Open the report with: "Advisory — does not block progress."** This skill has no authority to halt
the flow; it states findings so the user (or cook) can decide whether to fix the spec/plan or continue.
