# Artifact style — shared reference

The rules every human-read artifact a skill produces must follow: specs, plans, design docs,
review write-ups. A badly-formatted artifact defeats its own purpose, so these are not optional
polish — they are part of "done". Skills such as `znf:brainstorming`, `znf:writing-plans`,
and `znf:cook` cite this file instead of restating the rules.

These rules are project-agnostic. A project's own prose language and any domain term table live
in the project's convention, not here.

**Machine-read text is not an artifact and stays English**: a brief to a subagent, a commit
message, a memory, a rule, a skill. This holds whatever language the user wrote their request in —
a forked lead inherits the user's language and must not pass it on to its workers. Only what a
human reads (spec, plan, report, PR body) follows the project's prose language.

## Header metadata

Write each field as `**Label:** value` — the label in bold, the value immediately after on the
**same line** — one field per line, with a blank line between fields:

```
**Milestone:** M2 sub-project A

**Date:** 2026-09-02

**Author:** <name>

**Status:** Draft — awaiting approval
```

Three things this is NOT, each an actual mistake that has been caught. **All three are about the
header metadata block only** — they are not a ban on tables (or on `·`) anywhere else in the
document:

1. **Never a markdown table for the header block.** GFM always renders a header row, so a table
   header — whether labelled (`| Field | Value |`, which reads like a database dump) or blanked
   (`|  |  |`, which renders as an ugly empty grey bar) — is wrong for the header every time. There
   is no table form that avoids the header row.
2. **Never a single `·`-separated line** (`Status: … · Date: … · Author: …`) for the header. It
   reads as a dense wall.
3. **Never a lone bold label with the value indented on the line below.** That doubles the
   vertical whitespace and splits the label from its value, so it looks empty and disjointed. The
   label and its value share one line.

Everywhere else in the body, a markdown table is fine — and is the right choice wherever tabular
data scans better than prose or a list: a per-item matrix, a comparison, or a set of rows sharing
the same columns. Use one there without hesitation. The rule above is about the header, not the
document.

## Diagrams

Do not use a diagram the reader's viewer cannot render. If a ` ```mermaid ` fence shows as raw
code rather than a rendered diagram in the reader's markdown viewer, do not use mermaid — write
the flow as a numbered or bulleted plain-text list, using `→` and indentation. Plain-text flow
renders identically in every viewer. Confirm once how the reader views these files and carry the
answer in the project's convention.

## Titles and headings

Write headings in the artifact's own prose language, not half-and-half. Translate a word that has
a natural equivalent in that language; keep a technical term that developers deliberately never
translate — `registry`, `index`, `gate`, `slice`, `contract`, `drop-in`, `port`, `worktree`,
`monorepo`, `cache`, `metadata` — plus code identifiers, IDs, and paths. The test: a natural
target-language word exists → translate; well-known-in-English jargon → keep. Over-translating
jargon reads as wrong terminology.

Do not append a redundant hyphenated gloss to a heading (`## Brief (pre-work)`); pick one language
for the title and stop.

## Requirements and prose

- Number requirements (`FR-01`, `FR-02`, …) so tasks and reviews can cite them.
- No colloquialisms or spoken-idiom in a delivered artifact. Keep it plain and precise.
